# Search Jobs

This app will find a list of jobs with the links to apply for them from Indeed.com. Applying to different
positions inspired me to build an automated app to at least look for jobs with selected filters, so I would
be able to change only the name of the position and the filters would stay the same, instead of going
through the same process every time.

If you want to set up the app working with your specific arguments, you would need to go through the process:
1.Install [python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and virtual environment `pip install virtualenv`
2.Set up your virtual environment `virtualenv venv` and activate it
3.Install your dependencies `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
4.Run the application on your local machine `python app.py` and open in the browser the link from the description (on my computer it was http://localhost:5000/)
5.Change the beginning of app.py however you want
